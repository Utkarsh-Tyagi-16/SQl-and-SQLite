# üóÑÔ∏è SQL and SQLite

### Overview
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful standard language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is essential for querying, updating, and managing databases. SQLite, on the other hand, is a lightweight, self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration database engine, often used in mobile devices and embedded systems. It's perfect for projects where ease of use, simplicity, and portability are important.
